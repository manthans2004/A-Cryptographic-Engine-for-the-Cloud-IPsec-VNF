# üõ°Ô∏è VNF-IPSec: Containerized IPsec VPN for Secure Network Tunneling

This repository provides a **containerized IPsec (StrongSwan-based) VPN solution** using the `openvnf/vnf-ipsec` image.  
It supports both **environment-based configuration** and **manual configuration** for advanced network security research and demonstrations.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
docker run --privileged \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
    --env-file environment.sh \
    openvnf/vnf-ipsec
````

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration can be managed via **environment variables** or a separate file referenced by `$ENVFILE`.

### Example

```bash
# Source configuration file before startup
ENVFILE=environment.sh
```

## üß© Manual Configuration

You can bypass environment variables and mount a **custom StrongSwan configuration**.

Enable manual mode:

```bash
IPSEC_USE_MANUAL_CONFIG=TRUE
```

### Required Files

| File            | Destination                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ipsec.conf`    | `/etc/ipsec.config.d/ipsec.<connection-name>.conf`      |
| `ipsec.secrets` | `/etc/ipsec.secrets.de/ipsec.<connection-name>.secrets` |

### Optional Overrides

You may also provide:

```bash
/etc/ipsec.conf
/etc/ipsec.secrets
```

By default, **Charon** generates configurations dynamically.

To provide a custom Charon configuration:

```bash
IPSEC_MANUAL_CHARON=True
```

---

## üß† Enabling or Disabling Additional Modules

StrongSwan‚Äôs **Charon daemon** supports multiple plugins.
You can enable or disable modules by mounting configuration files under `/etc/strongswan.d/charon/`.

### Example: Disable FARP Module

Default `farp.conf`:

```bash
farp {
    load = no
}
```

To customize, mount your own configuration at:

```bash
/etc/strongswan.d/charon/farp.conf
```

## üîÅ Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) Support

The container supports **Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTI)** for routing IPsec traffic.

### Related Environment Variables

| Variable                 | Description                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `IPSEC_LOCALIP`          | Local IP bound to tunnel      |
| `IPSEC_VTI_KEY`          | Tunnel key (integer)          |
| `IPSEC_VTI_STATICROUTES` | Comma-separated static routes |
| `IPSEC_VTI_IPADDR_LOCAL` | Local VTI address             |
| `IPSEC_VTI_IPADDR_PEER`  | Peer VTI address              |

### Usage Example

Run the container with VTI initialization:

```bash
docker run --privileged \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
    -e IPSEC_VTI_KEY=10 \
    -e IPSEC_VTI_IPADDR_LOCAL=192.168.100.1/30 \
    -e IPSEC_VTI_IPADDR_PEER=192.168.100.2/30 \
    openvnf/vnf-ipsec
```

Add static routes (optional):

```bash
IPSEC_VTI_STATICROUTES=192.168.1.0/24,10.10.0.0/16
```

Would you like me to also include a **sample `environment.sh` file** (ready to run two peers like ‚ÄúSite-A‚Äù and ‚ÄúSite-B‚Äù for your demo)? That‚Äôll let you launch your IPsec tunnel in seconds.
